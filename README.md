Chickadee OS
============

This is Chickadee, a teaching operating system built for Harvard’s
[CS 161].

Quickstart: `make run` or `make run-PROGRAM` will run the OS using the
[QEMU] emulator.

Make targets
------------

`make NCPU=N run` runs the OS with `N` virtual CPUs (default is 2). Close
the QEMU window, or type `q` inside it, to exit the OS.

`make run-console` runs the OS in the console window.

`make SAN=1 run` runs with sanitizers enabled.

Chickadee’s debug log is written to `log.txt` by default. `make
LOG=stdio run` redirects the debug log to the standard output, and
`make LOG=file:FILENAME run` redirects it to `FILENAME`.

`make D=1 run` tells QEMU to print verbose information about interrupts
and CPU resets to the standard error. This setting will also cause QEMU to
quit after encountering a [triple fault][] (normally it will reboot).

`make run-PROGRAM` runs `p-PROGRAM.cc` as the first non-init process. The
default is `alloc`.

`make HALT=10 run-PROGRAM` should make QEMU exit 10 ticks (that is, 0.1 sec)
after all processes exit.

Troubleshooting
---------------

There are several ways to kill a recalcitrant QEMU (for instance, if your
OS has become unresponsive).

* If QEMU is running in its own graphical window, then close the window. This
  will kill the embedded OS.

* If QEMU is running in a terminal window (in Docker, for instance), then
  press `Alt-2` (or `Option-2`). This will bring up the QEMU Monitor, which
  looks like this:

    ```
    compat_monitor0 console
    QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
    (qemu)
    ```

    Type `quit` and hit Return to kill the embedded OS and return to your
    shell. If this leaves the terminal looking funny, enter the `reset` shell
    command to restore it.

    If `Alt-2` does not work, you may need to configure your terminal to
    properly send the Alt key. For instance, on Mac OS X’s Terminal, go to the
    Edit menu, select “Use Option as Meta key”, and press `Option-2`. You can
    also configure a special keyboard shortcut that sends the `Escape 2`
    sequence.

* Run `make stop` in another terminal. This will kill all QEMU processes you
  own. (If you’re using Docker, this other terminal must be open to the same
  Docker instance.)

Run `make run-gdb` to start up the OS with support for GDB debugging. This
will start the OS, but not GDB. You must run `gdb -x build/weensyos.gdb` to
connect to the running emulator; when GDB connects, it will stop the OS and
wait for instructions.

If you experience runtime errors involving `obj/libqemu-nograb.so.1`, put
`QEMU_PRELOAD_LIBRARY=` in `config.mk`. This disables a shim we use that
prevents QEMU from grabbing the mouse.

Build files
-----------

The main output of the build process is a disk image,
`chickadeeos.img`. QEMU “boots” off this disk image, but the image
could conceivably boot on real hardware! The build process also
produces other files that can be useful to examine.
